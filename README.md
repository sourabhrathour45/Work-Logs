# Work-Logs
It is a web-based tool for logging into your work sessions and improve your focus intensity concsiously.
You can clock in to start your work session and clock out when the work is over.
This will help you to stay away from distractions and have more productivity while working because it creates a conscious wall in your brain that you are working on a project.
The timer works even after reloading.
